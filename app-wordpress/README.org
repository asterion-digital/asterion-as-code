This repository captures the end to end workflow deploying [[https://wordpress.org/][wordpress]] on asterion digital infrastructure.


* Setup environment

Before we begin lets ensure we have our local ~KUBECONFIG~ environment variable set to our ~asterion-infra-kubeconfig~ file we created when we deployed our infrastructure.

#+NAME: Export kubeconfig
#+begin_src tmate
export KUBECONFIG=../asterion-infra-kubeconfig
#+end_src

Let's also set environment variables to reference our infra-stacks. Be sure to replace ~ORG~ with the name of your Pulumi organization.

#+NAME: Configure pulumi
#+begin_src tmate
pulumi config set rpiInfraStack ORG/asterion-rpi-infra/dev
pulumi config set awsInfraStack ORG/asterion-aws-infra/dev
#+end_src


* Create stack

Once our environment is set we can complete the application deployment. Our application will be deployed onto the asterion [[https://k3s.io/][k3s]] kubernetes cluster using the [[https://www.pulumi.com/blog/full-access-to-helm-features-through-new-helm-release-resource-for-kubernetes/][pulumi helm module]].

#+NAME: Bring pulumi stack up
#+begin_src tmate
pulumi up --yes
#+end_src


* Teardown stack

Need to make it all go away ðŸ˜…?  No problem, run the following to completely teardown this stack.

#+NAME: Teardown down the pulumi stack
#+begin_src tmate
pulumi destroy --yes
#+end_src
