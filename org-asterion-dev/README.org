This repository captures the end to end workflow for deploying asterion digital aws organization and iam via [[https://www.pulumi.com/][pulumi]].

Please note that this stack requires the [[https://github.com/asterion-digital/asterion-as-code/tree/master/org-asterion][org-asterion]] pulumi stack brought `up`.


* Setup environment

To get started lets initialise our project, making sure we are in the right directory, have the python [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html][virtual environment]] activated, and have installed our python dependencies with [[https://pypi.org/project/pip/][pip]].

#+NAME: Setup environment
#+begin_src tmate
# Start from the infra directory and initialise
cd org-asterion-dev && pulumi stack init dev

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install pip requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src


* Create configuration

Once our local environment is set up we can proceed with creating the required configuration entries in pulumi.

You can obtain the organization name of your pulumi account from the [[https://app.pulumi.com/signin][pulumi console]].

#+NAME: Create required pulumi configuration
#+begin_src tmate
echo "<org name>" | pulumi config set org
#+end_src

If you didn't install AWS CLI as per previous instructions, you will need to configure pulumi with a [[https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/aws/installation-configuration/][few more details]].


* Create stack and retrieve kubeconfig

Once we have our local pulumi configuration set we can bring up the organizational stack.

Currently this stack includes construction of the asterion organization in aws, with iam users and login profiles, as well as aws accounts to manage resources in different development environments, and roles that administrative iam users can assume to access these accounts.

#+NAME: Bring the stack up
#+begin_src tmate
pulumi up --yes
#+end_src

Asterion organization has now been deployed in aws! ðŸš€


* Teardown stack

Need to make it all go away ðŸ˜…?  No problem, run the following to completely teardown this stack.

#+NAME: Teardown down the pulumi stack
#+begin_src tmate
pulumi destroy --yes
#+end_src


From here, you can sign-in as one of the users, using the appropriate password in the pulumi output, into the aws console and create access keys to be able to interact with aws programatically or through the CLI.
